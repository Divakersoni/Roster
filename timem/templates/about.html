<p style="color:white;">An automatic Time-table Generator is a Python based website used to generate a clash-free timetable
automatically. Currently time-table is managed manually; it will help to manage all the periods
automatically. DTI will be able upload the time table in the system. Time table can be in the form of
Master TT(For one class), Faculty TT(For one teacher), Room TT(For one Room), Lab TT(For a
particular lab). CTTI will be able to add, delete or update the resource(Room, Lab, Faculty,
Department) of the college. CTTI can add or delete any DTI. CTTI can send the mail to all or any
students of the college. It will also manage time-table when any teacher is absent, coming late or
going early. Maximum and minimum work load for a faculty for a day and week will be specified
for the efficient generation of time-table. Faculty and student can mail to DTI for any query, or
request. DTI can request for centralized resources to CTTI. Any clash in any of the resource will be
identified by the system. DTI will be able to generate suggestive TT from the system and can change in the generated TT.</p>
